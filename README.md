# Peaky Blinders Presentation

> Status: Completed ü§òüèΩ

## "Peaky Blinders" TV show presentation website.

This project aims to show a presentation page of the TV series called Peaky Blinders. The project was originally designed by the owners of Dev em Dobro, to be developed during a week of live online studies.

The presentation page shows the title of the TV series (logo), followed by a paragraph (synopsis), as well as the background images that change according to the user's click on the round buttons located just below.

There is a side menu, on the right side of the screen, where two icons with links to my social media are located. 

Responsive web design approach was applied during the development of this website.

## Technologies I used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
